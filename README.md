Corruption is only possible when there is no accountability. Accountability in politics has come a long way, thanks to technology, but we are not there yet. Today, United States senators have their votes publicly available. Yet, the amount of data is so enormous that only partisan organizations have resources to hire people to comb through it. Senators, in turn, don't yet feel any obligations to explain their vote to the public. They are used to having supporters and haters after every vote. Voting consistently with the past campaign promises and previous public declarations is not prioritized.

This website is an attempt to change that. It uses crowdsourcing to identify inconsistent votes in a non-partisan way. Independent of your personal opinion on the vote, it is only inconsistent if it comes as a "surprise", contradicting senator's previous public declarations. Those are the votes that need more public attention.

The data loaded into the database is taken from [United States Congress repository](https://github.com/unitedstates/congress)
